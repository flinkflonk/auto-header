auto-header.el
==============

A boilerplate generator for (X)emacs.

Originally written in the 1990s by Espen Skoglund (see the actual code for
specifics), my "claim to fame" is the addition of emacs customization code
(Open the "Options" menu, "Customize Emacs", "Top Level Customization Group"
to enter the customization system, then it's under
"Programming"/"Tools"/"Auto Header")

Just put it in your .emacs directory or something, add it to your init.el
and it should be there. If it isn't, ask google, not me :D
